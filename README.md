# High Precision Computing

## Description

This project is a library that provides a num class for precise numerical calculations. It includes various math functions and operations for working with large numbers and achieving high precision. The library is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing users to write their own functions as needed. 

## Project Structure

The project repository has the following structure:

1. Source-code
   - Individual source files: This folder contains separate source files for different parts of the code, making it easier to navigate and modify specific sections.
   - Combined source file: The "num.hpp" file in this folder contains all the code combined into a single file, providing a convenient option for users who prefer a single-file solution.

2. Testing
   - Pi: This folder includes a cpp file for calculating pi and a txt file containing the true digits of pi obtained from reliable resources. The code can be used for testing and verification purposes.
   - e: Similar to the Pi folder, this folder contains the code for calculating the mathematical constant e and the true digits used for verification.
   - Golden Ratio: This folder includes the code for calculating the golden ratio and the true digits used for verification.

3. Final-Report
   - This folder contains the final report in PDF format, providing a comprehensive overview of the project and its findings. Additionally, the .rmd file used for generating the PDF is included for reference.

## Usage

To use this library, follow these steps:

1. Copy the "num.hpp" file to your working directory or add it to your include paths.
2. In your program, include the library using the following line:
   ```cpp
   #include "(Path)/num.hpp"
   ```
   Replace "(Path)" with the actual path to the "num.hpp" file.

## Contribution

This project is still a work in progress, and contributions are welcome. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional functions to add to the library, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
